# Understanding Your Results

Learn how to read and interpret the calculator's charts, tables, and key numbers to make informed decisions about your financial future.

## 📈 Reading the Chart

The chart is your visual roadmap to Coast FIRE. Here's how to read every element.

### The Blue Line (Without Contributions)

**What it shows:**
- Your portfolio value if you stopped saving TODAY
- Pure compound interest growth
- Your "safety net" scenario

**Why it matters:**
- If this line crosses the red line, you've hit Coast FIRE!
- Shows the power of compound interest alone
- Your baseline protection against future uncertainty

**How to use it:**
- Compare to orange line to see benefit of continued saving
- Watch where it crosses red line (your Coast FIRE milestone)
- Check its value at retirement age

**Example Reading:**
```
Blue line at retirement (age 65): $950,000
Red line (required): $1,000,000
Status: Close but not quite Coast FIRE yet
```

---

### The Orange Line (With Contributions)

**What it shows:**
- Your actual plan with monthly contributions
- Two distinct phases:
  1. **Steep rise:** While you're contributing
  2. **Gentle curve:** After you stop (coasting)

**Why it matters:**
- Shows your full potential with continued saving
- Visualizes the benefit of each additional year of saving
- Helps you see trade-offs of stopping at different ages

**How to use it:**
- Gap between orange and blue = value of future contributions
- Watch the transition point (when you stop contributing)
- Ensure it's well above red line at retirement

**Example Reading:**
```
Orange line at age 45 (stop contributing): $485,000
Orange line at age 65 (retirement): $1,350,000
Benefit vs stopping now: $400,000 extra
```

---

### The Red Dashed Line (Required Amount)

**What it shows:**
- Your target portfolio value at retirement
- Based on your expenses and withdrawal rate
- Stays flat because it's inflation-adjusted

**Why it matters:**
- Your minimum target for retirement
- The finish line you're trying to cross
- Determines your Coast FIRE number

**How to use it:**
- Your portfolio lines must be above this at retirement
- If lines cross it before retirement, you're ahead of schedule
- If they never cross it, you need to adjust your plan

**Example Reading:**
```
Red line: $1,000,000 (4% withdrawal = $40,000/year)
If you need $50,000/year: Line would be at $1,250,000
If you need $35,000/year: Line would be at $875,000
```

---

### The Retirement Phase (After Age 65)

**What it shows:**
- Portfolio behavior with annual withdrawals
- Extends 10 years past retirement
- Shows sustainability of your plan

**Three possible patterns:**

**1. Growing (Best Case)**
```
Age 65: $1,200,000
Age 70: $1,280,000
Age 75: $1,350,000
```
- Your returns > withdrawal rate
- Building extra cushion
- Very sustainable

**2. Flat (Good Case)**
```
Age 65: $1,000,000
Age 70: $1,010,000
Age 75: $1,005,000
```
- Returns ≈ withdrawal rate
- Maintaining value
- Sustainable

**3. Declining (Warning)**
```
Age 65: $1,000,000
Age 70: $910,000
Age 75: $805,000
```
- Withdrawals > returns
- Eroding principal
- May not last 30+ years

**Action items if declining fast:**
- Reduce withdrawal rate from 4% to 3.5%
- Plan to reduce spending in retirement
- Consider part-time work in early retirement
- Increase expected returns (more stocks)

## 📊 Understanding the Table

The year-by-year projection table shows your complete financial journey. Here's how to read each column.

### Column 1 & 2: Age and Year

**What it shows:**
- Your age and calendar year for each row

**Special indicators:**
- ⚡ = Age when you stop contributing
- 🎯 = Your retirement age
- 🏖️ = Retirement years (with withdrawals)

**How to use it:**
- Quick reference for any specific age
- Find your retirement row easily
- Track progress over time

---

### Column 3: Portfolio Value (Today's $)

**MOST IMPORTANT COLUMN!**

**What it shows:**
- Real purchasing power
- What your money can actually buy
- Inflation-adjusted values

**Why it matters:**
- This is your TRUE wealth
- Use this for all planning decisions
- Ignore the nominal column for planning

**Example:**
```
Age 65 Portfolio: $1,200,000 (Today's $)
This means: You can buy $1,200,000 worth of today's goods
If your expenses are $40,000/year today, you can buy 30 years of expenses
```

---

### Column 4: Portfolio Value (Nominal)

**What it shows:**
- What your actual bank statement will say
- Inflated by 2.5% annually
- Not adjusted for inflation

**Why it matters:**
- Sets expectations for account balances
- Looks impressive but is misleading
- Only useful for checking against actual statements later

**Example:**
```
Age 65:
Today's $: $1,200,000
Nominal: $1,687,000
Difference: $487,000 is just inflation
```

**Important:** If you see $1.7M in your account at 65, remember your purchasing power is only $1.2M in today's dollars!

---

### Column 5: Difference (Inflation Impact)

**What it shows:**
- Gap between nominal and real values
- Total inflation impact over time
- How much value inflation "steals"

**Why it matters:**
- Shows why inflation matters
- Demonstrates why we plan in real terms
- Helps set realistic expectations

**Example:**
```
Age 35: Difference = $0
Age 45: Difference = $98,000
Age 55: Difference = $264,000
Age 65: Difference = $487,000
```

Over 30 years at 2.5% inflation, nearly 40% of nominal value is inflation!

---

### Column 6: Total Contributed

**What it shows:**
- Running sum of all monthly contributions
- Your out-of-pocket investment
- Does not include growth

**Why it matters:**
- Shows how much YOU put in
- Compare to portfolio value to see growth
- Helps understand return on investment

**Example:**
```
Age 35: Total Contributed = $0
Age 40: Total Contributed = $90,000 (60 months × $1,500)
Age 45: Total Contributed = $180,000 (stop contributing)
Age 65: Total Contributed = $180,000 (no new contributions)

Portfolio at 65: $1,200,000
You contributed: $180,000
Investment growth: $1,020,000 (567% return!)
```

**Key insight:** After you stop contributing, this number stays constant!

---

### Column 7: Investment Growth (Today's $)

**What it shows:**
- Money made from compound returns
- The "magic" of Coast FIRE
- Everything beyond contributions

**Why it matters:**
- This is compound interest in action
- Should be MUCH larger than contributions
- The reason Coast FIRE works

**Example:**
```
Age 40: 
Portfolio: $350,000
Contributed: $120,000
Growth: $230,000 (192% of contributions)

Age 65:
Portfolio: $1,200,000
Contributed: $180,000
Growth: $1,020,000 (567% of contributions!)
```

**The Coast FIRE Miracle:**
Even though you stopped contributing at 40, growth from age 40-65 adds $790,000!

---

### Columns 8 & 9: Annual Income (Withdrawal Rate %)

**What it shows:**
- How much you can withdraw each year
- Based on your selected withdrawal rate (default 4%)
- Shown in both today's dollars and nominal

**Why it matters:**
- This is your actual retirement income
- Must cover your expenses
- Adjusts dynamically with withdrawal rate changes

**Example with 4% Withdrawal Rate:**
```
Portfolio: $1,000,000
Annual Income (4%): $40,000/year
Monthly Income: $3,333/month
```

**Comparing Different Rates:**
| Portfolio | 3.5% Rate | 4.0% Rate | 4.5% Rate | 5.0% Rate |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| $1,000,000 | $35,000 | $40,000 | $45,000 | $50,000 |
| $1,200,000 | $42,000 | $48,000 | $54,000 | $60,000 |
| $1,500,000 | $52,500 | $60,000 | $67,500 | $75,000 |

**Important Notes:**
- Lower rate = safer, portfolio lasts longer
- Higher rate = more income, but riskier
- The table headers update when you change the withdrawal rate
- Make sure this income covers your estimated expenses!

## 🎯 Row Indicators Explained

### ⚡ Stop Contributing Row (Amber Background)

**What it means:**
- Last year of monthly contributions
- Transition from "saving phase" to "coasting phase"
- Portfolio continues growing from here

**What to look for:**
- Portfolio value at this age
- Years remaining until retirement
- Total amount you'll have contributed

**Example:**
```
Age 40 ⚡ (Stop Contributing)
Portfolio: $285,000
Years to retirement: 25
Total contributed: $144,000
Will grow to: $1,053,000 at retirement
```

---

### 🎯 Retirement Row (Purple Background)

**What it means:**
- Your target retirement age
- End of growth phase
- Beginning of withdrawal phase

**What to look for:**
- Portfolio value in "Today's $" column
- Compare to required amount (red line)
- Ensure it's at or above your target

**Example:**
```
Age 65 🎯 (Retirement)
Portfolio: $1,200,000 (Today's $)
Required: $1,000,000
Buffer: $200,000 (20% cushion) ✅
Annual Income: $48,000 @ 4% withdrawal
```

---

### 🏖️ Retirement Years (Amber Background)

**What it means:**
- Years after retirement
- Portfolio declining with withdrawals
- Testing sustainability

**What to look for:**

Age 65: $1,200,000
Age 70: $1,180,000 (declining $4K/year)
Age 75: $1,150,000 (declining $6K/year)
Rate: Acceptable, sustainable ✅

vs. Bad Example:
Age 65: $1,000,000
Age 70: $850,000 (declining $30K/year)
Age 75: $680,000 (declining $34K/year)
Rate: Too fast! Unsustainable ⚠️
```

```
Age 65: $900,000

Shortfall: $150,000 ⚠️ PROBLEM!
```

**Solutions:**
- Increase monthly contributions now
- Work until 67 or 68 instead of 65
- Reduce expected retirement expenses
- Increase expected return (riskier investments)

---

**3. Declining More Than 1% Per Year in Retirement**
```
Age 65: $1,000,000
Age 66: $985,000 (1.5% decline)
Age 67: $968,000 (1.7% decline)
Age 68: $950,000 (1.9% decline) ⚠️ CONCERNING
```

**Solutions:**
- Reduce withdrawal rate from 4% to 3.5%
- More aggressive allocation in retirement
- Flexible spending (cut back in bad years)
- Part-time work for first few years

---

**4. Never Reaching Coast FIRE**
```
Current age: 35
With $1,500/month contributions
Coast FIRE age: Never ⚠️ PROBLEM!

Current savings: $50,000
Coast FIRE target: $285,000
Gap: $235,000
Monthly for 10 years: Need $2,400/month
```

**Solutions:**
- Dramatically increase savings rate
- Adjust retirement age to 67 or 70
- Lower expected retirement expenses
- Combination of all three

---

### Yellow Flags (Caution)

**1. Less Than 10% Buffer at Retirement**
```
Required: $1,000,000
Portfolio: $1,050,000 (5% buffer)
```
Not ideal—aim for 15-20% buffer.

**2. Aggressive Return Assumptions**
```
Expected return: 9%
Inflation: 2%
Real return: 6.9%
```
This is aggressive—consider 7% total return instead.

**3. High Withdrawal Rate**
```
Using 5% safe withdrawal rate
Historical success: ~85%
```
Consider 4% or 3.5% for higher confidence.
