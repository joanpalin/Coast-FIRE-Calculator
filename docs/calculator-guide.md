  - IRA contributions
  - Any other retirement investing
- **Example:** $1,500/month = $18,000/year
- **Tip:** Track for 3 months to get accurate average
- **Set to $0:** If you want to see "pure" Coast FIRE (stop saving completely)

---

### Stop Contributing At Age
- **What it is:** Age when you'll stop adding money and start "coasting"
- **Why it's powerful:** Test "what if I stopped saving at 40?"
- **Example:** 40 (stop saving 25 years before retirement)
- **Use cases:**
  - Planning to have kids and lose an income
  - Want to change to lower-paying passion career
  - Planning a business venture
  - Just curious if you've saved enough
- **Tip:** Try different ages to see trade-offs

---

### Expected Annual Expenses in Retirement ($)
- **What it is:** How much you'll spend per year in retirement
- **Critical:** This is in TODAY'S dollars (inflation-adjusted)
- **How to estimate:**
  1. Start with current annual expenses
  2. Subtract work costs (commute, work clothes, lunches out)
  3. Add retired life costs (healthcare, hobbies, travel)
  4. Consider paid-off mortgage
- **Example Breakdown:**
  - Housing: $15,000
  - Food: $6,000
  - Healthcare: $8,000
  - Travel: $5,000
  - Entertainment: $3,000
  - Misc: $3,000
  - **Total: $40,000/year**
- **Common mistakes:**
  - Forgetting healthcare ($500-1,000/month for couple)
  - Assuming too low (boredom is expensive!)
  - Not planning for travel/hobbies
- **Tip:** Look at retirees you know—what do they spend?

---

### Expected Annual Return (%)
- **What it is:** Average investment growth per year
- **Historical data:**
  - S&P 500 (stocks): ~10% nominal
  - Bonds: ~5% nominal
  - Balanced portfolio: ~7-8% nominal
- **Conservative:** 6-7%
- **Moderate:** 7-8%
- **Aggressive:** 8-10%
- **Example:** 7%
- **Reality check:** Markets fluctuate wildly year-to-year, but average out over decades
- **Tip:** Use 7% if you're not sure. It's reasonable for stock-heavy portfolio.

---

### Expected Inflation Rate (%)
- **What it is:** How much prices increase each year
- **Historical US average:** 2-3%
- **Recent years:** Higher (3-5%)
- **Standard assumption:** 2.5%
- **Why it matters:** $1 today ≠ $1 in 30 years
- **Example:** 2.5%
- **Tip:** Use 2.5-3% for conservative planning

---

### Safe Withdrawal Rate (%)
- **What it is:** Percentage of portfolio you can withdraw annually
- **The famous "4% rule":**
  - Based on Trinity Study (1998)
  - Withdraw 4% of starting portfolio
  - Adjust for inflation each year
  - Historically, portfolio lasted 30+ years
- **Modern consensus:**
  - 3.5%: Very safe (98% success)
  - 4.0%: Safe (95% success)
  - 4.5%: Moderate risk (90% success)
  - 5.0%: Higher risk
- **Example:** 4%
- **Reality:** Depends on:
  - Retirement length (30 vs 40 years)
  - Asset allocation
  - Flexibility to adjust spending
- **Tip:** Use 4% unless you have specific reasons to change

## 🔍 Common Questions About Fields

**Q: Should I include my spouse's retirement accounts?**  
A: If you're planning retirement together, yes! Add all combined savings.

**Q: What if my employer match is vested over time?**  
A: Only include the vested portion in current savings. Include full match in monthly contributions.

**Q: Should I adjust for Social Security?**  
A: The calculator doesn't include Social Security. This makes your plan more conservative. SS is a bonus on top!

**Q: How do I know my real investment return?**  
A: Log into your accounts and look at "rate of return" or "performance" over the past 1-3 years. But remember, use long-term averages (7%) for planning.

**Q: Can I change my retirement age later?**  
A: Absolutely! Life changes. Update the calculator annually with your latest thinking.

- **Real Return:** After adjusting for inflation (e.g., 4.37%)
- **Why it matters:** Real returns show actual purchasing power growth

### The Power of the Stop Age

- **Career change:** Stop at 45 to pursue passion project
- **Kids:** Stop during child-raising years
- **Business:** Stop to start a business venture

### Withdrawal Rate Sensitivity
Small changes make big differences:
- 3.5% withdrawal = $35,000/year on $1M (safer)
- 4.0% withdrawal = $40,000/year on $1M (standard)
- 4.5% withdrawal = $45,000/year on $1M (riskier)

Over 30 years, these differences compound significantly!
