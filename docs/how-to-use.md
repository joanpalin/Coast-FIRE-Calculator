# How to Use the Calculator

Step-by-step guides for getting the most out of the Coast FIRE Calculator, from first-time use to advanced scenario planning.

## 🚀 First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Gather Your Information (10 minutes)

Create a document with:

**1. All Retirement Account Balances**
- 401(k) from current employer
- Old 401(k)s from previous employers
- Traditional IRAs
- Roth IRAs
- Taxable investment accounts (for retirement)
- Total: $______

**2. Monthly Contributions**
- Your 401(k) contribution: $______
- Employer match: $______
- IRA contributions: $______
- Other retirement investing: $______
- Total monthly: $______

**3. Current Annual Expenses**
Track for 3 months and multiply by 4, or review last year:
- Housing: $______
- Food: $______
- Transportation: $______
- Healthcare: $______
- Entertainment: $______
- Other: $______
- Total annual: $______

**4. Estimated Retirement Expenses**

- Keep: Housing, food, utilities
- Add: Healthcare (if under 65), hobbies, travel
- Estimated total: $______

---

### Step 2: Enter Basic Information

Start conservative:
```
Current Age: [Your actual age]
Target Retirement Age: 65 (traditional)
Current Savings: [Your total from Step 1]
Monthly Contribution: 0 (see pure Coast FIRE first)
Annual Expenses: [Estimate from Step 1]
```

Leave other fields at defaults:
- Expected Return: 7%
- Inflation Rate: 2.5%
- Safe Withdrawal Rate: 4%

---

### Step 3: Check Your Coast FIRE Status

Look at the status box:

**If GREEN (Reached Coast FIRE):**
- 🎉 Congrats! You can stop saving if you want
- Note the "At Retirement (no contributions)" number
- This is what you'll have if you stop now

**If ORANGE (Not there yet):**
- Note "additional amount needed"
- This is what you need to reach Coast FIRE TODAY
- Note the percentage complete

---

### Step 4: Add Monthly Contributions

Now enter your actual monthly savings:
```
Monthly Contribution: [Your actual amount]
```

Watch the orange line appear on the chart!

Check the status box again:
- If still orange, note "You'll reach Coast FIRE in X years"
- This tells you when you can stop saving

---

### Step 5: Experiment with Stop Age

Try different scenarios:
```
Stop Contributing At Age: 40
```

Then try: 45, 50, 55

Watch how the chart changes. See the trade-offs:
- Stop earlier = smaller retirement fund
- Save longer = bigger retirement fund

---

### Step 6: Review the Chart

The chart shows your journey:
- **Blue line:** If you stop saving now
- **Orange line:** With your contribution plan
- **Red dashed line:** Amount you need at retirement

Look for:
- When orange crosses red (you're on track!)
- Behavior after retirement (does it decline or grow?)
- Visual confirmation of your plan

---

### Step 7: Review the Table

Scroll down to the year-by-year table:
- Find your retirement age row (🎯 symbol)
- Look at "Portfolio Value (Today's $)" column
- Check the retirement years (🏖️ symbol)
- Ensure portfolio doesn't hit $0

## 🎯 Advanced Usage Techniques

### Technique 1: The Three-Scenario Method

Always test these three scenarios:

**1. Conservative (Worst Case)**
- Return: 6%
- Inflation: 3%
- Withdrawal Rate: 3.5%
- Monthly Contribution: [Your current]

**2. Realistic (Expected Case)**
- Return: 7%
- Inflation: 2.5%
- Withdrawal Rate: 4%
- Monthly Contribution: [Your current]

**3. Optimistic (Best Case)**
- Return: 8%
- Inflation: 2%
- Withdrawal Rate: 4%
- Monthly Contribution: [Your current]

**Decision Rule:** If the worst case is acceptable, you're in great shape!

---

### Technique 2: The Reverse Engineering Approach

**Goal:** Figure out the monthly contribution needed to reach Coast FIRE by a target age.

**Steps:**
1. Set your target age for Coast FIRE (e.g., 40)
2. Start with Monthly Contribution: $0
3. Check "Years until Coast FIRE" in status
4. Increase monthly contribution by $500 increments
5. Stop when "Coast FIRE Age" matches your target

**Example:**
- Target: Reach Coast FIRE by age 40 (10 years)
- Try $0/month: Coast FIRE at 52
- Try $500/month: Coast FIRE at 46
- Try $1,000/month: Coast FIRE at 42
- Try $1,500/month: Coast FIRE at 40 ✅

**Result:** You need to save $1,500/month to hit your goal!

---

### Technique 3: The Life Event Planner

Test major life events before they happen.

**Having a Baby:**
```
Current: Saving $2,000/month
Years 1-3: $500/month (reduced for childcare costs)
Years 4+: $1,500/month (back to higher savings)
```

Unfortunately, calculator doesn't support variable contributions, so test:
- Scenario A: $500/month for all years
- Scenario B: $1,500/month for all years
- Your reality will be between these bounds

**Starting a Business:**
```
Age 35-40: Stop contributing ($0/month)
Age 40+: Resume $1,000/month
```

Test by setting Stop Age to 40.

---

### Technique 4: The Retirement Age Sensitivity Test

Don't commit to a specific retirement age until you've tested alternatives.

**Test These:**
- Age 60: Earlier retirement, need more savings
- Age 62: Social Security earliest eligibility
- Age 65: Medicare eligibility
- Age 67: Full Social Security benefits
- Age 70: Maximum Social Security benefits

**Look at:**
- Portfolio size at each age
- How much more you need to retire earlier
- Whether extra years of work are worth it
