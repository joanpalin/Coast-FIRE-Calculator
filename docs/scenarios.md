# Testing Different Scenarios

Master scenario planning to explore all your options and make confident decisions about your financial future.

## 🎯 The Five Core Scenarios

Every Coast FIRE planner should test these five fundamental scenarios to understand their options.

---

## Scenario 1: The Status Quo

**Purpose:** Understand your baseline trajectory

**Setup:**
```
Current Age: [Your age]
Current Savings: [Your actual amount]
Monthly Contribution: [Your actual amount]
Stop Contributing: [At retirement age]
All other fields: Your realistic assumptions
```

**What to record:**
- Coast FIRE age (when you could stop saving)
- Portfolio at retirement
- Annual retirement income
- Years of saving required

**Example Results:**
```
Current age: 35
Coast FIRE age: 45 (10 years away)
Portfolio at 65: $1,200,000
Annual income: $48,000
Total to contribute: $216,000
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Am I satisfied with this timeline?
- Is the retirement income sufficient?
- Can I maintain these contributions?
- What happens if I change jobs?

---

## Scenario 2: Coast FIRE Now

**Purpose:** Discover if you can stop saving immediately

**Setup:**
```
Monthly Contribution: $0
Stop Contributing: [Current age]
All other fields: Same as Scenario 1
```

**What to record:**
- Portfolio at retirement (with no new contributions)
- Annual retirement income
- Whether you've reached Coast FIRE

**Example Results:**
```
Stop saving at: 35 (today)
Portfolio at 65: $900,000
Annual income: $36,000
Status: Need $135,000 more to reach Coast FIRE
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Is $900,000 enough for my needs?
- Could I live on $36,000/year?
- What if I retire at 67 instead of 65?
- How does this compare to keep saving?

**Decision framework:**
```
If retirement income ≥ expected expenses → You can stop now!
If retirement income = 80-99% of expenses → Close, consider options
If retirement income < 80% of expenses → Keep saving for now
```

---

## Scenario 3: The Sabbatical

**Purpose:** Quantify the cost of taking a career break

**Setup:**
```
Stop Contributing: [Start of break, e.g., age 40]
Monthly Contribution: $0 (simulating the break)
All other fields: Same as Scenario 1
```

**What to record:**
- Portfolio at retirement with break
- Difference vs continuous saving
- Cost per year of break

**Example Results:**
```
Option A - Continuous saving until 65:
Portfolio at 65: $1,200,000

Option B - Stop at 40 (5-year break before planned stop at 45):
Portfolio at 65: $1,050,000

Cost of break: $150,000
Cost per year: $30,000
```

**Advanced calculation:**
If you resume saving after the break, test a third scenario:
```
Option C - 5-year break, then resume:
Stop at 40, resume at 45 with monthly contributions
(Calculator doesn't support this directly, but you can estimate)
```

**Questions to ask:**
- Is the life experience worth $150,000?
- Could I work part-time during the break to offset?
- Would I regret not taking the break?
- Can I make it up later?

---

## Scenario 4: The Aggressive Push

**Purpose:** Find your fastest path to Coast FIRE

**Setup:**
```
Monthly Contribution: [2x your current amount]
Try: [1.5x], [2x], [2.5x], [3x] your current contribution
Stop Contributing: [Varies - when Coast FIRE is reached]
```

**What to record for each level:**
- Coast FIRE age
- Total amount to contribute
- Years of aggressive saving
- Portfolio at retirement

**Example Results:**
```
Current: $1,500/month
- Coast FIRE at: 45
- Years saving: 10 years
- Total contributed: $180,000

Double ($3,000/month):
- Coast FIRE at: 40
- Years saving: 5 years
- Total contributed: $180,000

Triple ($4,500/month):
- Coast FIRE at: 38
- Years saving: 3 years
- Total contributed: $162,000
```

**The surprise:** Sometimes saving more aggressively requires LESS total contribution because you reach Coast FIRE sooner!

**Questions to ask:**
- Can I realistically save this much?
- Is 3 years of intense saving worth 7 years earlier freedom?
- What would I need to cut?
- Could I increase income instead of cutting expenses?

---

## Scenario 5: The Lean FIRE

**Purpose:** See how reduced expenses change your timeline

**Setup:**
```
Annual Expenses: [75% of current estimate]
Try: 90%, 80%, 75%, 70% of current expenses
All other fields: Same as Scenario 1
```

**What to record:**
- Coast FIRE target (how much you need today)
- Coast FIRE age
- Portfolio required at retirement
- How close you are to Coast FIRE

**Example Results:**
```
Original ($40,000/year expenses):
- Coast FIRE target: $285,000
- Current savings: $150,000
- Need: $135,000 more

Lean ($30,000/year expenses - 25% reduction):
- Coast FIRE target: $214,000
- Current savings: $150,000
- Need: $64,000 more (already 70% there!)
```

**The power of lean:**
Reducing expenses by 25% cuts your Coast FIRE target by ~25%!

**Questions to ask:**
- What could I cut without reducing happiness?
- Which expenses are worth keeping?
- Could I live this way long-term?
- Would I feel deprived?

## 📊 Advanced Scenario Testing

### Investment Return Scenarios

Test three return assumptions to understand sensitivity.

**Conservative (5% real return):**
```
Expected Return: 7.5%
Inflation: 2.5%
Real return: 5%
```

**Moderate (7% total return):**
```
Expected Return: 7%
Inflation: 2.5%
Real return: 4.37%
```

**Aggressive (9% total return):**
```
Expected Return: 9%
Inflation: 2.5%
Real return: 6.34%
```

**Example comparison:**
```
Starting with $150,000, saving $1,500/month for 10 years:

Conservative (5% real):
- Portfolio at retirement: $950,000

Moderate (7% total):
- Portfolio at retirement: $1,200,000

Aggressive (9% total):
- Portfolio at retirement: $1,520,000

Range: $570,000 difference!
```

**Key insight:** Returns matter enormously over 30+ years!

**Decision rule:**
- Plan with moderate assumptions (7%)
- Hope for aggressive results (9%)
- Prepare for conservative reality (5%)
- If conservative case works, you're golden!

---

### Inflation Scenarios

Test how different inflation rates affect your plan.

**Low (2% inflation):**
```
Expected Return: 7%
Inflation: 2%
Real return: 4.9%
```

**Moderate (2.5% inflation):**
```
Expected Return: 7%
Inflation: 2.5%
Real return: 4.37%
```

**High (4% inflation):**
```
Expected Return: 7%
Inflation: 4%
Real return: 2.88%
```

**Example comparison:**
```
Starting with $200,000, no contributions, 30 years:

Low (2% inflation):
- Real portfolio: $1,007,000

Moderate (2.5% inflation):
- Real portfolio: $847,000

High (4% inflation):
- Real portfolio: $476,000

Range: $531,000 difference!
```

**Key insight:** High inflation is devastating to long-term plans!

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Invest in stocks (inflation hedge)
- Plan with 2.5-3% inflation
- Monitor actual inflation annually
- Adjust contributions if needed

---

### Withdrawal Rate Scenarios

Test different safe withdrawal rates to understand income flexibility.

**Ultra-Safe (3.5%):**
```
Safe Withdrawal Rate: 3.5%
Historical success: 98%
Best for: 40+ year retirements
```

**Standard (4%):**
```
Safe Withdrawal Rate: 4%
Historical success: 95%
Best for: 30-35 year retirements
```

**Aggressive (5%):**
```
Safe Withdrawal Rate: 5%
Historical success: 85%
Best for: Risk-tolerant, flexible spenders
```

**Example comparison:**
```
Portfolio at retirement: $1,000,000

Ultra-Safe (3.5%):
- Annual income: $35,000
- Very sustainable

Standard (4%):
- Annual income: $40,000
- Historically sustainable

Aggressive (5%):
- Annual income: $50,000
- Requires flexibility
```

**Decision factors:**
- **Use 3.5% if:** Long retirement (40+ years), want maximum safety
- **Use 4% if:** Standard retirement (30-35 years), comfortable with historical data
- **Use 5% if:** Flexible spending, can reduce in bad years, other income sources

## 🎮 Scenario Planning Templates

### Template 1: Career Change Analysis

**Scenario:** Moving to lower-paying but fulfilling work

**Current Situation:**
```
High-stress job: $100,000/year
Saving: $2,500/month
Current age: 35
Coast FIRE age: 42
```

**New Opportunity:**
```
Dream job: $70,000/year
Can save: $1,200/month
Would start: Age 37
```

**Testing:**
1. **Scenario A:** Stay in high-stress job
   - Continue $2,500/month
   - Coast FIRE at 42
   - Portfolio at 65: $1,450,000

2. **Scenario B:** Switch at 37
   - Save $2,500/month until 37 (2 years)
   - Save $1,200/month from 37-65
   - Portfolio at 65: $1,280,000

3. **Scenario C:** Reach Coast FIRE first, then switch
   - Save $2,500/month until 42
   - Stop saving at 42, switch to dream job
   - Portfolio at 65: $1,450,000

**Analysis:**
- Option C: Best of both worlds!
- 5 extra years of stress, but then total freedom
- Same retirement outcome as staying in stressful job forever

### Template 2: Geographic Arbitrage

**Scenario:** Working in expensive city, retiring in low-cost area

**Current Location (NYC):**
```
Annual expenses: $65,000
Need at retirement: $1,625,000
Coast FIRE target: $458,000
```

**Retirement Location (Low-cost US city):**
```
Annual expenses: $40,000
Need at retirement: $1,000,000
Coast FIRE target: $282,000
```

**Arbitrage Benefit:**
```
Savings to reach Coast FIRE:
- NYC lifestyle: Need $458,000
- Low-cost lifestyle: Need $282,000
- Difference: $176,000 (38% less!)

You reach Coast FIRE faster by planning lean retirement!
```

**Strategy:**
- Work in high-cost, high-pay city
- Save aggressively while earning more
- Plan retirement in low-cost area
- Reach Coast FIRE years earlier

---

### Template 3: Partial Early Retirement

**Scenario:** Semi-retiring at 55, full retirement at 65

**Setup:**
```
Current age: 35
Save until: 50 ($2,000/month)
Coast from: 50-55 (no saving)
Partial retirement: 55-65 (part-time income covers expenses + save $500/month)
Full retirement: 65
```

**Calculator simulation:**
```
Phase 1 (Age 35-50): Save $2,000/month
- Stop at: 50
- Portfolio: $650,000

Phase 2 (Age 50-55): Coast
- No contributions
- Portfolio grows to: $835,000

Phase 3 (Age 55-65): Semi-retired + save $500/month
- Add: $60,000 over 10 years
- Portfolio at 65: $1,250,000
```

**Benefits:**
- Retire at 55 (10 years early!)
- Keep contributing lightly
- Bridge to full retirement
- More income than full Coast FIRE

## 🎯 The Monte Carlo Method

While the calculator doesn't do Monte Carlo simulation, you can approximate it:

**Manual Monte Carlo:**
Test 9 scenarios combining three variables:

**Returns:** 6%, 7%, 8%  
**Inflation:** 2%, 2.5%, 3%  
**Expenses:** 90%, 100%, 110% of estimate

**Create a matrix:**

| Return | Inflation | Expenses | Portfolio at 65 | Safe? |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| 6% | 3% | 110% | $890,000 | ⚠️ Close |
| 7% | 2.5% | 100% | $1,200,000 | ✅ Yes |
| 8% | 2% | 90% | $1,520,000 | ✅ Yes |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Results:**
- 7/9 scenarios successful: 78% success rate
- 2/9 scenarios concerning: Need adjustment
- Worst case: $890,000 (still close to $1M target)

**Decision:** Plan is solid, but build in 10% buffer for safety.

---

## 🔬 Stress Testing Your Plan

### The Worst-Case Scenario Test

**Combine worst assumptions:**
```
Expected Return: 5% (below historical)
Inflation: 4% (high)
Safe Withdrawal: 3.5% (conservative)
Expenses: 110% of estimate (buffer)
Major market crash: Lose 40% in year 1 of retirement
```

**If your plan survives this, you're bulletproof!**

**Example:**
```
Normal plan: $1,200,000 at retirement
Worst case: $875,000 at retirement
With 40% crash: $525,000 year 1
Recovery over 5 years: $675,000 at age 70

Can you live on $23,600/year (3.5% of $675K)?
If yes → Plan is extremely robust!
If no → Need more buffer
```

## 💡 Pro Scenario Planning Tips

### Tip 1: The "Rule of Three"
Always test at least 3 scenarios:
1. Best case
2. Expected case  
3. Worst case

If worst case is acceptable, proceed confidently!

### Tip 2: The "One Variable at a Time" Rule
When testing scenarios, change ONE variable at a time to understand its impact.

Bad approach:
```
Change return from 7% to 8%
AND change expenses from $40K to $35K
AND change withdrawal rate from 4% to 5%
```
You won't know which change mattered!

Good approach:
```
Scenario 1: Just change return to 8%
Scenario 2: Just change expenses to $35K
Scenario 3: Just change withdrawal to 5%
```

### Tip 3: The "Life Happens" Buffer
Add 10-20% to everything:
- Expenses: Plan for 10% more than you think
- Timeline: Assume you'll work 1-2 years longer
- Savings: Target 10% more than calculator says

Life never goes exactly to plan!

### Tip 4: The Annual Adjustment
Run all scenarios again every year:
- Markets change
- Your goals evolve
- Life circumstances shift
- Update and iterate!
