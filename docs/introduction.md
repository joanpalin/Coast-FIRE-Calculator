# Introduction to FIRE & Coast FIRE

Learn the fundamental concepts behind Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) and the Coast FIRE approach.

## What is FIRE?

**FIRE** stands for **Financial Independence, Retire Early**. It's a movement focused on saving and investing aggressively to achieve financial freedom much earlier than the traditional retirement age of 65.

**Core Principle:** Save enough money so that investment returns can cover your living expenses forever, without needing to work.

**The Math:** If you need $40,000/year to live and follow the "4% rule," you need:
- **$40,000 ÷ 0.04 = $1,000,000**
- With $1M invested, you can withdraw $40,000/year indefinitely (historically speaking)

### Traditional FIRE Example

**Meet Sarah:**
- Age: 30
- Current savings: $50,000
- Annual expenses: $40,000
- Savings rate: 50% of income ($30,000/year)
- Goal: $1,000,000 to fully retire

**Sarah's Plan:**
- Saves aggressively for ~20 years
- Reaches $1M by age 50
- Retires completely at 50
- Never has to work again

**Challenges:**
- Extremely aggressive saving (often 50-70% of income)
- Requires major lifestyle sacrifices for 15-20 years
- Can feel overwhelming and restrictive

## What is Coast FIRE?

**Coast FIRE** is a more relaxed variation where you save aggressively for a shorter period, then **stop saving** and let compound interest do the rest. You still work, but only enough to cover current expenses—no retirement saving required.

**The Key Difference:**
- **Traditional FIRE:** Save until you have enough to retire NOW
- **Coast FIRE:** Save until you have enough to retire AT 60-65 (traditional age)

### Coast FIRE Example

**Meet James:**
- Age: 30
- Current savings: $50,000
- Annual expenses: $40,000
- Target retirement: Age 65 (35 years away)
- Needs at 65: $1,000,000

**James's Discovery:**
At 7% real returns, his $50,000 will grow to $1,067,000 in 35 years **without adding another penny!**

**James's Plan:**
- Age 30: Has $50,000 → Reached Coast FIRE! ✅
- Age 30-65: Works part-time, travels, pursues passions
- Only needs to earn enough to cover today's $40,000 expenses
- No pressure to save for retirement—it's handled
- Age 65: Has $1,067,000 → Retires fully

**Benefits:**
- Freedom at age 30 instead of age 50
- Can take lower-paying dream jobs
- Can work part-time
- Can take career breaks or sabbaticals
- Significantly less financial stress

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional FIRE | Coast FIRE |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Savings Phase** | 15-20 years of intense saving | 5-10 years of saving, then done |
| **After Goal** | Complete retirement | Work for fun/expenses only |
| **Flexibility** | All-or-nothing | Very flexible |
| **Pressure** | High (must maintain lifestyle) | Low (just cover expenses) |
| **Career Freedom** | Wait until FIRE | Immediate after Coast FIRE |
| **Required Amount** | 25x annual expenses NOW | Smaller amount that grows |
| **Timeline** | Retire at 40-50 | Retire at 60-65 |

## Real-World Example: The Power of Coast FIRE

**Emma's Story:**

**Starting Position (Age 28):**
- Saved: $100,000
- Salary: $60,000/year
- Expenses: $40,000/year
- Can save: $20,000/year ($1,667/month)

**Option 1 - Traditional FIRE:**
- Needs: $1,000,000 to retire fully
- Timeline: ~15 more years of aggressive saving
- Result: Retires at 43
- Lifestyle: Tight budget until 43

**Option 2 - Coast FIRE:**
- Needs: $285,000 to coast to retirement at 65
- Timeline: ~9 years of saving
- Result: Reaches Coast FIRE at 37
- At 37: Can quit high-stress job, do consulting 20 hrs/week
- At 65: Has $1.1M to retire on

**Emma Chooses Coast FIRE:**
- Age 37: Reached Coast FIRE ($285K saved)
- Ages 37-65: Works as freelance consultant (flexible schedule)
- Takes 3-month trips annually
- Spends more time with kids growing up
- No retirement saving stress
- Age 65: Fully retires with $1.1M

**The Key Insight:** Emma gets 28 years of flexible freedom (ages 37-65) versus retiring at 43. For many, that's a better trade-off!

## Who Should Consider Coast FIRE?

Coast FIRE might be right for you if:

✅ You're willing to save aggressively for 5-10 years  
✅ You value flexibility and lifestyle freedom  
✅ You're okay working longer (but more flexibly)  
✅ You want to pursue passion projects or lower-paying work  
✅ You'd like to work part-time or freelance  
✅ You want to take career breaks without derailing retirement  
✅ Traditional FIRE feels too extreme  

Coast FIRE might NOT be right for you if:

❌ You want to fully retire as soon as possible  
❌ You hate your job and can't imagine working longer  
❌ You have significant income now but uncertain future  
❌ You need structure and deadlines to stay motivated  
❌ You're already close to traditional FIRE

## The Math Behind Coast FIRE

The power of Coast FIRE comes from **compound interest** over time.

**Example Calculation:**
- Current age: 35
- Target retirement: 65 (30 years away)
- Need at retirement: $1,000,000
- Expected real return: 7%

**Coast FIRE Target Today:**
```
$1,000,000 ÷ (1.07)^30 = $131,367
```

If you have $131,367 today at age 35, you can stop saving! It will grow to $1M by age 65.

**The Earlier You Start, The Less You Need:**
- Age 25 (40 years to grow): Need $66,780 today
- Age 30 (35 years to grow): Need $93,663 today
- Age 35 (30 years to grow): Need $131,367 today
- Age 40 (25 years to grow): Need $184,249 today
- Age 45 (20 years to grow): Need $258,419 today

**Time is your greatest asset!**

## Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: "Coast FIRE means you're lazy"
**Reality:** You're making an intentional choice to value flexibility over maximizing wealth. You're still working and contributing to society.

### Myth 2: "I'll never be able to save that much"
**Reality:** Many people reach Coast FIRE earlier than they think, especially if they start young and invest consistently.

### Myth 3: "What if I need to retire earlier?"
**Reality:** Reaching Coast FIRE is your safety net. You can always keep saving to retire even earlier if you want.

### Myth 4: "The market could crash"
**Reality:** These calculations use long-term historical averages. Markets are volatile short-term but reliable over 20-30+ years.

### Myth 5: "I'll miss out on compound growth"
**Reality:** You're not missing out—you already captured the growth! Your money IS compounding, just without new contributions.
