## ✨ What is Coast FIRE?

**Coast FIRE** (Financial Independence, Retire Early) means you've saved enough that you can **stop contributing to retirement** and let your investments grow through compound interest until traditional retirement age (60-65).

**Traditional FIRE vs Coast FIRE:**
- **Traditional FIRE**: Save aggressively for 15-20 years → Retire completely at 40-50
- **Coast FIRE**: Save aggressively for 5-10 years → Work for expenses only → Retire at 60-65

**The Benefits:**
- ✅ Financial freedom years earlier
- ✅ Take lower-paying passion jobs
- ✅ Work part-time or freelance
- ✅ Take career breaks and sabbaticals
- ✅ Significantly less financial stress

## 📊 Calculation Methodology

### Key Formulas

**Real Return Rate:**
```
Real Return = ((1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation)) - 1
```

**Coast FIRE Target:**
```
Coast FIRE Target = Required Portfolio / (1 + Real Return)^Years to Retirement
```

**Future Value with Contributions:**
```
FV = PV × (1 + r)^n + PMT × (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)
```

**Safe Withdrawal:**
```
Annual Income = Portfolio Value × Withdrawal Rate
```

### Assumptions
- Returns are compounded annually
- Contributions are made monthly
- All projections are in real (inflation-adjusted) terms
- Safe withdrawal rate follows the Trinity Study methodology
- Sequence of returns risk is not explicitly modeled
